# Iris Flower Classification

This project aims to classify Iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) based on their sepal and petal measurements using machine learning.

## Dataset

The project uses the famous Iris flower dataset, a classic benchmark in machine learning. The dataset contains 150 instances, with 50 instances for each of the three Iris species. Each instance includes four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handling missing values (if any).
   - Encoding categorical features (species).

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualizing data patterns using scatter plots and correlation heatmaps.

3. **Model Selection:**
   - Several classification models were evaluated, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Neural Network.
   - **Neural Network** was chosen as the primary model due to its superior performance in accuracy.

4. **Model Training:**
   - The Neural Network model was trained using the preprocessed data.
   - Hyperparameter tuning was performed using RandomizedSearchCV to optimize the model's performance.

5. **Model Evaluation:**
   - The model was evaluated using metrics like precision, recall, accuracy, and F1-score.

6. **Prediction:**
   - The trained model was used to classify a new, unseen data point.

## Results

- The Neural Network model achieved high accuracy in classifying Iris flowers.
